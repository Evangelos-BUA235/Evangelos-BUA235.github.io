    <h2>Hello world!</h2>
	
	<P>My name is Evangelos Stasinos, and I am eighteen years of age. I come from the small city of Peabody Massachusetts, which is a half hour or so out of Boston. I live in the boring suburban part of the city that used to be a proud farming community in the early 1900s. In fact, my house was a pig barn just sixty short years ago. Prior to this semester, I did a semester in the bioengineering major. That is, until I realized that wasn’t something I could wake up and do every day for the rest of my life. Before college I went to a trade school, and by my senior year I was on co-op as an intern at Krochmal Farms. I did soil chemistry and topography for the farm; checking nutrient levels and making run-off maps on ArcMap 10.2.2. I spent my summers doing 45 hours a week as a carpenter.</P>
	<P>I went to trade school for four years in the Natural Resources Management department at Essex Technical High School in Hathorne (not Hawthorne) Massachusetts. While there I did soil chemistry, water chemistry, silviculture, macroinvertebrate studies, wetland management, forest ecology, and sustainable energy. I got my certification for OSHA 10, and became National Interpretive Guide certified. I was a member of the Future Farmers of American, and even went to the FFA National convention for a marketing career development event. It was a project where we took a local agricultural business, and attempted to improve their business model. I placed first at both states and regionals, but fell short at nationals, winning only the bronze. By the end sophomore year, I decided that trade school was not where I wanted my education to end. I wanted to go to college.</P>
	<P>I played volleyball in high school, and at a mere 5’7” I was told volleyball might not be for me. Unfortunately, I missed my calling for track. While overtraining the summer before my junior year of high school, I injured my knees. My track career was cut short by having patella tendinitis in both knees. I spent all junior year on the bench, and I didn’t have the heart to return to the sport after that. Then I found volleyball. Kim Hill, Igor Kobzar, Filippo Lanza, and Zhu Ting. Some of my favorite volleyball players, and some of the best in the sport. I watched hours upon hours of volleyball my junior year. I went to physical therapy, I got better, and by my senior year I managed to get a group of interested young men together, and our school had its first men’s volleyball team. I was co-captain with the only other senior on the team, Madison Murphy. I never missed a practice, I worked twice as hard to compete half as well as all the taller guys, and I made it. Outside hitter. I even played at the University of Maine for a while, but eventually my course work made it harder and harder to be able to go to practice. My GPA is far more important than playing on some club team, but I still love the sport.</P>
